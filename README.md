# Claude Code Tour

An interactive walkthrough of the entire [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) documentation — 140 pages organized into a sensible reading order, with read-tracking and full-text search.

Content is fetched from `code.claude.com/docs/en/*.md` and bundled at build time. The official source remains the authoritative one; this is an offline reading aid.

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # http://localhost:5173
```

## Build for hosting

```bash
pnpm build        # → dist/
pnpm preview      # serve the built site at :4173
```

The `dist/` folder is a static SPA — host it anywhere (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, S3, GitHub Pages).

## Slash command

A `.claude/commands/claude-code-tour.md` is included. To make it available from any Claude Code session:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/commands
cp .claude/commands/claude-code-tour.md ~/.claude/commands/
```

Then in any project: `/claude-code-tour`.

## Refresh content

Re-run the downloader to pick up upstream doc changes:

```bash
cd raw-docs && cat urls.txt | xargs -n1 -P8 ./download.sh
```
